\section{ Chapter 1 }
\subsection{ Problem 1 }
This is a sample solution for problem 1.1. The below is some latex that
will be used in the solution \[\int_{a}^b f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a)\] In the
above its clear that the define integral \(f\).


\subsection{ Problem 2 }
This is a sample solution for problem 1.2. The below is some latex that
will be used in the solution \[a = b = c = d\] In the above its clear
that \(inline\). The end.
