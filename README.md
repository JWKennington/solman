# solman
**Sol**utions **man**ual writing utility. Though this utility is written in Python, the user is not expected to write
any python as part of writing solutions. Rather, the solutions are written individually as markdown files (.md) in a 
meaningful directory structure. This package aims to convert those separate solutions into a variety of outputs, 
including a single LaTeX file as well as Pelican-compatible blog posts / web pages.
